# darkweb-threat-analysis


**Dataset Overview**

This project uses publicly available cybersecurity datasets that contain dark-web related traffic, malware metadata, and encrypted communication patterns. The datasets help analyse how malicious and normal behaviour appear in network flows and metadata.

The datasets are used in the project for:

Classifying traffic as Normal or Malware using Random Forest

Identifying trends and behaviour patterns across timestamps

Extracting feature importance to understand what attributes drive malicious activity

Visualising activity using charts (confusion matrix, pie chart, trend line)

All datasets used here are research-safe, anonymised, and publicly accessible, and they allow the entire ML pipeline to be reproduced on any machine.
